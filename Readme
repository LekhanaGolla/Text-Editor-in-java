This Java program implements a basic text editor with some common editing functions.
The user interface is built with Swing, a set of GUI components included in the Java Foundation Classes (JFC). 
The editor supports creating new files, opening existing files, saving changes to files, and printing the current document.
The editing functions include cut, copy, and paste. The user can access these features through the menu bar or with keyboard shortcuts. 
The text editor uses a JTextArea component to display and edit the text. The program uses file I/O classes to read and write files from the file system.
The user can choose a file to open or save using a JFileChooser dialog. The program also sets the look and feel of the UI to MetalLookAndFeel with an OceanTheme. 
This code is a good starting point for anyone learning Java Swing or interested in building a simple text editor.
